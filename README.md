# Repository for Agar
## What is Agar?
Agar is a layer between Kelp and other backends. Agar can be interpreted or compiled using any toolchains, although none is currently implemented and the specification is lacking right now.
## Why not compile directly to a backend?
Agar insn't really a compiler, Agar is a programming language. Not intended for programmers, but rather it allows for other programs that provide backend specific code.
## What backends are available?
Currently? None.
## What backends are planned?
There are plans to create an interpreter and binding to either cranelift or LLVM.
## Can I program in Agar?
Yes, you can. It's a simple text file, but it isn't very pleasing language.
## Can I contribute?
Yes you can! Most of my work is currently on the "kelp t agar" side, so you are free to open a PR!
## What does Agar look like?
